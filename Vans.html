            <p>The V-Class is available with three of the latest model four-cylinder diesel engines. These engines are characterized by high torque, economic consumption and low noise. The 100 and 120 kW variants are equipped with a powerful and efficient 6-speed manual transmission as standard. The 140 kW variable comes with all 4MATIC all-wheel drive variants with 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission with speed control, start assist, power switch, immobilizer system and DYNAMIC SELECT key. This key is used to select one of the four driving programs that configure parameters such as engine, transmission, suspension, and steering characteristics. In addition, the V-Class is also equipped with a comfortable suspension system to ensure superior driving comfort in every situation. Good driving dynamics, roll stability and exceptional noise comfort make the V Series a quiet companion. The V AVANTGARDE series features the AGILITY CONTROL suspension, a damping system that delivers balanced driving pleasure by improving rolling behavior, damping, and stability to match road conditions. The V EXCLUSIVE sports suspension is based on the AGILITY CONTROL suspension and is under 15mm, which improves handling. (For more information click on the picture)</p>

            <p>With the growth of electric cars increasing every year and few EV electric options for families, Volkswagen Microbus 2019 aims to tackle a largely untapped market. The Microbus title celebrates the memory of the famous German company Type 2 Microbus - or VW Bus for short - that inspired the old design of the new truck. The fully electric powertrain provides approximately 300 miles of driving range, and its cabin will feature flexible seating configurations. (For more information click on the picture)</p>
